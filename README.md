# Text2Arch
## Download
```
git clone https://github.com/mozi1924/text2arch.git
```
This is actually a quaternary encoder that uses [mdui](https://www.mdui.org) as the interface

Hereâ€™s how it works
```
0 = 1
1 = use
2 = arch
3 = btw
```

I made this for fun and abstraction because someone yelled at me for saying "i use arch btw"
